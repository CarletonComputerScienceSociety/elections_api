# CCSS Elections API

This is a server that will record votes from students for CCSS elections. 

The API recieves an AES-256 encrypted ciphertext from the SCS that verifes that it is in fact a student voting. Inside the decrypted ciphertext is a hashed version of the student number is used to identiy unique students. This prevents the CCSS from knowing how specific students voted. Also, no data is sent back to the SCS, so they do not have any information on how students voted either.
